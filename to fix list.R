# to fix in OSM model:

2. no loss model

5. cost_connect_pred and cost_connect_prev need to be calculated in cap Plan

7. to add segment by cm phone types (h/b/m, h/m etc.)

8. to  add Out-of-time validation for the models

9. to predict weekdays in models. now they set as "3"

10. to somehow handle predictions based on rare observations (e.g. 1st attempt on preview for Cont list):
   - to add 95% intevals
   - exlude from predictions
